How to use cheats in SH2.
It's a tough game I know, so if you want to try out wreaking havoc on helpless ponies who can't fight back, here's your chance!

Note: Use of any cheat will disable the ability to unlock achievements or earn knives. Cheats will reset to disabled on starting a new game.

To unlock a cheat, open your NOTES via the icon which is usually available on the right-hand side of the screen. Enter the cheat, making sure you use all caps. If you are successful, you will hear a sound effect and the cheat's name will appear.
The Cheats
OATMEAL? ARE YOU CRAZY?

Every pony in town except you will be instantly sent completely insane. Insane ponies won't carry out their jobs, so you'll be able to kill almost with impunity. However, the Magician will now never lower their shield if active!
